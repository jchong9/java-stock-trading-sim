      <p>
        This is the first page you will see when you open the trading application. As you may notice, there is no place for you to register. This is because the account you registered on the website is recognized by the program and will be the account you use to trade your stocks. This is why you must register on the website before opening the application. If there are errors with the login, an appropriate message will show, as you can see below:

        DISCLAIMER: DO NOT CLICK VIEW PROFILE MORE THAN ONCE IN A MINUTE.<br>We use an API to retrieve stock data in real time. Unfortunately, we do not have the funds to purchase a paid API, so we used a free one. With the free API comes limitations, and the major limitation is that we do not have many API calls available per minute. Opening the portfolio twice in the minute will not provide you will all the required information. If we were to publish this project, we would invest in an API that would be able to handle many API calls per minute.
